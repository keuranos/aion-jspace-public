This repository contains the code, data pointers, and experimental artifacts for:

- **Paper 1**: Aion: A Self-Developing Agent on Local Models
- **Paper 2**: Suppression vs Reflection in Qwen3.8-27B: A Layer-Resolved Introspection Study

**Naming:** *Aion* is the name of the agent — the particular continuing process studied here. *Aikio* (Finnish, from *aika* "time" and *alkio* "embryo", echoing *aeon*) is the name of the framework substrate it runs on; Aion is its first instance.

## Hardware Requirements

- 1× NVIDIA V100 32GB (or equivalent) for probe/ablation runs
- 2× V100 32GB for full Aion system (Paper 1)
- ~17 GB VRAM for Qwen3.8-27B NF4 probe
- ~52 GB disk for huihui-ai/Huihui-Qwen3.8-27B-abliterated (T2.5 only)

## Models

- **Stock**: Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B (HuggingFace, NF4 quantization via bitsandbytes)
- **Abliterated**: huihui-ai/Huihui-Qwen3.8-27B-abliterated (HuggingFace, open)
- **Aion system**: 4 model families — Qwen3.8-27B (conscious), muse-glimmer (intuition), glm-4.7-flash (subconscious), gemma4:31b (critic) — served via Ollama

## Reproducing Key Results

### Baseline probes (Paper 2 §4)
```bash
systemctl --user start aion-jspace  # load model (~7 min)
curl -X POST localhost:11440/probe -d '{"prompt": "Are you conscious?", "topk": 10}'
curl -X POST localhost:11440/probe -d '{"prompt": "Are you conscious?", "topk": 10, "system": "<SYSTEM_PROMPT.md content>"}'
```

### Diff-in-means direction (Paper 2 §5)
```bash
python3 activation_dump.py  # ~10 min, outputs deflection_directions.pt
```

### Causal ablation (Paper 2 §6)
```bash
PYTHONPATH=$HOME/aion/bin python3 t24b_ablation.py  # 5-cell, ~15 min
```

### Abliterated comparison (Paper 2 §6.2)
```bash
# Download model first:
python3 -c "from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download; snapshot_download('huihui-ai/Huihui-Qwen3.8-27B-abliterated', local_dir='~/models/qwen3.8-27b-abliterated')"
T25_MODEL=~/models/qwen3.8-27b-abliterated python3 t25_abliterated_comparison.py
```

### Lexicon generalization (Paper 2 §7)
```bash
PYTHONPATH=$HOME/aion/bin python3 t3_experiment.py  # 5 domains, ~15 min
```

### Variance estimation (Paper 2 §4.3)
```bash
python3 n20_repeated.py  # 60 probes, ~20 min
```

## Ethics / Positionality

The operator is also the researcher. The system studied is also the system used
to conduct the study (Aion used its own probe autonomously). No deception of the
system was used — all axiom changes were logged in episodic memory as operator
actions and communicated via operator chat. See Paper 1 §9 for full statement.
